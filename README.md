# TicTacTest

## Introduction

This game of tic tac toe was made for me to learn to program rust, but also to make a basic graphics function library, for my other project, [Quantum](https://github.com/ArchGryphon9362/Quantum)

## Requirements

[Rust](https://rustup.rs/), obviously

To build, simply run

```sh
cargo build
```
